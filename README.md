# Bike Rental Analysis

A lot of cities around the world are implementing bike rental stations as part of their integrated transport systems. Additional to increasing the available options of moving around the city, these systems bring a lot of positive consequences to urban spaces, like reducing gas emissions, traffic jams and improving the health of citizens. To have a system working, it's essential to have the correct capacity for satisfying the needs of the users. This correct capacity requires continuous maintenance, relocation, and acquisition of new bikes.

The goal of this project is using data available from [Washington DC's bike sharing system](https://secure.capitalbikeshare.com/map/) and some additional information gathered, for predicting the number of bicycles needed per day on some temporal and weather conditions. This type of predictions help the system managers to handle their capacity, program better maintenance times and keep their user rate increasing.

## Dependencies and Execution

The analysis and modelling in this project was done in Python using a Jupyter notebook. The following dependencies are needed in order to run the project:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- SciKit learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

The first chunk of code in the notebook [Bike Rental Analysis](src/Bike_Rental_Analysis.ipynb) contains all the specific libraries and functions from the previous dependencies. For running this project, you should clone this repository into your local machine, and run the [Bike Rental Analysis](src/Bike_Rental_Analysis.ipynb) jupyter notebook from the console.
